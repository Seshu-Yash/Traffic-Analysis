## Introduction

Road safety is a critical concern, and this project leverages Power BI to analyze traffic-related data for a comprehensive understanding. The dashboard provides insights into total casualties, accident severity, vehicle types involved, monthly trends, road types, and more.

## Project Objectives

- **Year-over-Year (YoY) Comparison:** Compare key metrics such as total casualties and accidents to identify trends and patterns.

- **Accident Severity Analysis:** Understand the distribution of casualties based on accident severity.

- **Vehicle Type Impact:** Analyze the impact of different vehicle types on road safety.

- **Location-based Analysis:** Explore the distribution of casualties based on location, time of day, and road type.

## Data Source

The project utilizes a structured dataset related to traffic incidents, including information such as casualties, accident severity, vehicle types, and location. The data source can be customized based on the specific requirements of the transportation or law enforcement agency.

## Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard is designed to be user-friendly and informative. It includes multiple visualizations, interactive charts, and filters to facilitate a deep dive into traffic analytics. The dashboard allows users to explore different aspects of road safety seamlessly.

## Key Metrics

1. **Total Casualties and Accidents:** Understand the overall impact of traffic incidents on casualties and the number of accidents.

2. **Accident Severity Analysis:** Analyze the distribution of casualties based on accident severity, including fatal, serious, and slight injuries.

3. **Vehicle Type Impact:** Explore the contribution of different vehicle types to total casualties.

4. **Location-based Analysis:** Understand the distribution of casualties based on road type, location, and time of day.

5. **Monthly Trends:** Visualize the monthly trends of casualties and accidents, enabling stakeholders to identify patterns and seasonality.

## Data Transformation

The dataset undergoes various transformations to clean and structure the data for effective analysis. Power BI's data shaping capabilities are utilized to handle missing values, outliers, and create calculated columns for relevant metrics.

## Visualizations

The Power BI dashboard includes a variety of visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and maps to represent data trends and patterns effectively. Customized visuals are used to enhance the user experience and facilitate quick decision-making.
